1. The R language is a dialect of which of the following programming languages?

Fortran

Scheme

Lisp

S

Solution: R is a dialect of the S language which was developed at Bell Labs.

2.  The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? Select all that apply.

The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.

# The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.

This is not part of the free software definition. Freedom 0 requires that the users of free software be free to use the software for any purpose.

The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.

# The freedom to sell the software for any price.

This is not part of the free software definition. The free software definition does not mention anything about selling software (although it does not disallow it).

# The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.

This is not part of the free software definition. Freedoms 1 and 3 require access to the source code.

The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.

3. In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT: (Select all that apply)

numeric

array

'array' is not an atomic data type in R.

matrix

'matrix' is not an atomic data type in R.

data frame

'data frame' is not an atomic data type in R.

complex

character

logical

list

'list' is not an atomic data type in R.

integer

table

'table' is not an atomic data type in R.

4. If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

real

complex

list

matrix

integer

numeric

vector

Ans: numeric

5. 

What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?

numeric

integer

list

logical

matrix

character

Answer: Numeric.  The numeric class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.

6. 

If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?

a vector of length 2

a vector of length 3

a matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows

a 2 by 3 matrix

a 3 by 3 matrix

a 2 by 2 matrix

answerz: a matrix with 2 col and 3 rows. The 'cbind' function treats vectors as if they were columns of a matrix. It then takes those vectors and binds them together column-wise to create a matrix.


7. 

A key property of vectors in R is that

a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions

the length of a vector must be less than 32,768

elements of a vector all must be of the same class

elements of a vector can be of different classes

Answer: elements of a vector all must be of the same class

8. 

Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me? Select all that apply.

a numeric vector containing the element 2.

a numeric vector of length 1.

a list containing the number 2.

Answer: a numeric vector containing the element 2.
        a numeric vector of length 1.
        
9. 

Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?

a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.

a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 4.

an integer vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 4.

a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.

a numeric vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 6.

an integer vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.

Answer: a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.

10. 

Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

x[x > 4] <- 10


x[x == 10] <- 4

x[x > 10] <- 4

x[x > 10] == 4

x[x < 10] <- 4

x[x >= 11] <- 4

x[x == 4] > 10

x[x >= 10] <- 4

answer: x[x>10]<-4 and x[x>=11]<-4
